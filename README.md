## 🚀 About Me
I'm a full stack developer...


# Hi, I'm Vishal! 👋

An aspiring Full-Stack Web Developer I enjoy creating things that live on the Internet. My interest in web development started back last year when I was trying to edit things on the web - taught me a lot about HTML and CSS.

Fast forwarding to today, I built a number of web applications and 2 major projects. Learned a great deal about teamwork, leadership and communication. After months of regorous training, here I am looking for an oppertunity as a full stack web developer.
